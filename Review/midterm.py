fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "grapes"]


#1. use a for loop to print out each fruit in fruits

name = "Daniel"

#2. use a for loop to print out each character in name

sentence = "The ants go marching one by one"

#3. use a for loop to print out each word in sentence

###################################
#Without editing the above code:

#1. add the key "d" with value 4 and
#2. delete the key "b" from the dictionary
#3. use a for loop to print all the keys
#4. use a for loop to print all the values
#5. create an empty dictionary d_rev and use a for loop
#to store put the reverse of d in d_rev (i.e., make 1 map to "a", etc. )

#without editing the above code

#1. append "run" to the value of "file1.txt"
#2. append "ran up the hill" to the value of "file2.txt"
#3. print(d_l)
# you should get something like

#1. write code to store in char_cnt how many times each character
# in song occurs

#2. write code to store in word_cnt how many times each word appears in song
